## Preface

* `DigitalOcean` is a cloud computing platform that allows users to create virtual servers, also known as "Droplets". A Droplet is essentially a virtual machine that is created in DigitalOcean's infrastructure. It is a remote computer that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. The droplet will be running Debian.
* `Debian`, also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the community-supported Debian Project.
* `Linux` is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel. Windows + Mac OS are 2 other popular operating systems. Linux provides a flexible, low-cost, and efficient platform for cloud computing. By using Linux, hobbyists can experiment with different configurations and environments, and take advantage of the large and active community of developers and users who support the operating system.
* We will interface with this Linux virtual machine hosted by DigitalOcean running Debian mainly though `ssh` + a shell. A `shell` is a command-line interpreter and typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. 
* `ssh` (also referred to as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. 
* We will orchestrate provisioning of the droplet's state/configuration with `Ansible`. Ansible is a suite of software tools that enables infrastructure as code. It is open-source and the suite includes software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment functionality.
* We will use Ansible to run `playbooks`. Ansible playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. Some of these playbooks may contain tasks that are shell scripts. 
* A `shell script `is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.
* We will install software using `Homebrew`. Homebrew is package manager for Macs which makes installing lots of different software simpler.
* We will also need to generate an `SSH public/private key pair`. An SSH public key is needed to authenticate and securely access a remote server via SSH (Secure Shell). The public key is stored on the server, while the corresponding private key is kept by the user. When the user tries to access the server, the server checks the public key to verify that the user has permission to access the system. In this way, SSH public keys provide a secure and reliable method for remote access to servers.
* We will also use `environment variables`, a key part of shell scripting. Environment variables are system-wide variables that contain information about the environment in which a program or process is running. They are used to configure and customize the behavior of programs and scripts, and can be accessed by any program or process running on the system.
* We will also use `.zprofile`. Files like .zprofile are used to store environment variables so that they persist across multiple sessions or logins (like opening a new session in Terminal.app). When a user logs in to a system, the shell (such as Bash or Zsh) reads the configuration files in the user's home directory, including .zprofile, and sets the environment variables accordingly. This ensures that the environment variables are available to all programs and scripts run by that user.
* We will also use `scp`. scp (secure copy) is a command-line utility for securely copying files between a local host and a remote host, or between two remote hosts. It is similar to the cp (copy) command, but uses the SSH protocol for secure file transfer.
* We will also use `port forwarding / tunneling`. Port forwarding or tunneling is a technique used to securely transmit data over a network by redirecting network traffic from one network port to another. We do this because by default for security, all inbound traffic is blocked to the DigitalOcean droplet (to prevent malicious actors from harming our resources). This allows us to control access to our servers exposed TCP/IP ports.
* `IPv4 / TCP/IP ports` are a way to identify specific processes or services running on a networked computer. They are 16-bit numbers that range from 0 to 65535 and are used to direct incoming network traffic to the appropriate process or service. 
* `DNS (Domain Name System)` and IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) are two essential components of the Internet infrastructure that work together to enable communication between computers and other devices. DNS maps domain names to IP addresses. IPv4 uses IP addresses to identify devices on the Internet. DNS and IPv4 work together to enable communication between devices on the Internet by translating human-readable domain names into the numerical IP addresses used to route data between devices.
* `HTTP` is a protocol for transmitting data over the Internet. `HTTPS `is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data to make it more secure, using SSL/TLS encryption and certificates to verify the identity of the server.
* `JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)` is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used for transmitting data between servers and web applications
* `YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)` is a human-readable data serialization format that is often used for configuration files and data exchange between applications. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and to work well with scripting languages
* A `web service` is a way for different devices or applications to communicate and share information over the internet. It acts like a bridge, allowing them to request and receive data from each other without direct interaction.
* An `API request` is a request made by a client to a server using a defined protocol, such as HTTP. In this case, the API request is sent to a web service built using the Node.js + Express framework running as an OCI container in a k8s pod managed with ArgoCD/Helm charts. The OCI image is built with `kaniko` from the source code in the `git repository`. 
* A `client` sends an API request to a Node.js Express microservice using HTTP. The request includes a `JSON request body` with data or parameters. The microservice processes the request, housing logic, and generates a `JSON response body` with the results or a status message. This response is sent back to the client. This is typically done in a `web browser` or with `curl` / `wget`.
* `curl` is a computer software project providing a library and command-line tool for transferring data using various network protocols.
* `wget` is a computer program that retrieves content from web servers. It is part of the GNU Project. Its name derives from "World Wide Web" and "get". It supports downloading via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP.

These shell scripts will automatically provision on the DigitalOcean hosted virtual machine:
  * `Git` is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
  * `GitHub` is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. 
  * `Kubernetes`, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    * `K3s` is an official CNCF sandbox project that delivers a lightweight yet powerful certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads across resource-restrained, remote locations or on IoT devices.
    * `Argo CD`, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
    * `Helm` is a package manager for Kubernetes that streamlines the process of installing and managing applications on a Kubernetes cluster. Helm works by defining an application's Kubernetes resources, such as deployments, services, and config maps, in a YAML file. This file is known as a Helm chart, and it can be packaged and shared with others as a pre-configured application package. By using Helm charts, developers can easily deploy their applications to a Kubernetes cluster, without having to manually manage and configure the underlying Kubernetes resources. 
    * `Kubernetes Dashboard` is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources. You can use Dashboard to get an overview of applications running on your cluster, as well as for creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc).
    * `OCI (Open Container Initiative)` containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated environments for running applications. They are built on top of a standardized format for container images, making it easy to move container images between different container runtimes and platforms. OCI containers store the application code, libraries, and dependencies needed to run the application, as well as any configuration files or data that are required. This data is stored in layers, which are stored in the container image and can be shared between multiple containers.
    * `Docker Registry` is a server side application that stores and lets you distribute OCI images. The OCI Image Format project creates and maintains the software shipping container image format spec (OCI Image Format). We need the registry to serve OCI images we build (for our custom applications) since Kubernetes pulls from a registry when orchestrating workflows (it's the format code/servers/jobs are stored in).
  * `Elasticsearch `is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. 
  * `Kibana` is a data visualization dashboard software for Elasticsearch.
  * `Node.js` is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 
    * `Express` is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js.
    * A `package.json` +  file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.
    * A `package-lock.json` file is a JSON file that is automatically generated by Node.js when you install dependencies for a project using the npm (Node Package Manager) tool. It is used to keep track of the exact versions of all the packages that are installed, including their dependencies, so that they can be reliably and consistently reproduced across different environments. This ensures that everyone working on the project is using the same versions of the packages, which can help prevent issues related to version conflicts and other inconsistencies.
    * A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
  * `kaniko` is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster.
